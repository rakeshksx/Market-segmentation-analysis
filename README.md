Market Segmentation with Clustering
Introduction
In this lesson, we'll learn about one of the most popular use cases for clustering in the business world -- market segmentation!

What is Market Segmentation?
Perhaps the most common use case for clustering algorithms in the real world, Market Segmentation refers to using Cluster Analysis to segment a customer base into different market segments using the clustering techniques we've learned.

Consider the following scenario: You're a movie executive, and you have a new superhero film coming out. You need to decide how to best allocate your advertising budget in order to attract the most customers. This film is a sequel, so you have good demographic data on who went to see the last film. The advertising options available to you are TV, newspaper, radio, and internet. How do you best allocate your advertising budget to ensure that the movie does as well as possible?

The answer depends on your data. A regression analysis on last year's data can give you a general idea of how much you can expect to make overall, assuming that there aren't major differences between last year and this year. However, regression just tells you what you can expect overall -- what if we're trying to optimize where we spend our money, rather than just predict what the returns will be, based on the overall amount of money we spent?

The answer lies in knowing who your customer is. All forms of advertising are not consumed equally by every age group or demographic. By identifying segments in our customer data, we can look for trends that identify one group or another, and create personalized regression models for each group.

In order to understand this better, let's take a sample question that market segmentation can help us answer. For our TV advertising budget, we still have to decide what channel to run our commercials on. What effect will advertising on the Disney channel have on a person's likelihood of coming to see our superhero movie? If the person in question is 12 years old, then it's probably very likely that our commercial convinces this person to see our movie. But what about if they're 68 years old? In that case, advertising during a cartoon on the Disney channel might not be the most effective way to reach that person. If we're worried about reaching this customer, the first question we should ask is what kind of customer they are. In the case of a superhero movie, we can likely assume that all things equal, a 12-year-old child is more likely to be interested in seeing a superhero movie after seeing our commercial than a 68-year-old, so we should probably pay attention to what the data tells us about how 12-year-olds are affected by each type of media advertisement we can use!
